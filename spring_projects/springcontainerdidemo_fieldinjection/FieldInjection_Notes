Field injection introduces a dependency of the Spring container, 
as the @Autowired annotation is a Spring component; thus, the bean is no longer 
a POJO and cannot be instantiated independently.

Field injection cannot be used for final fields. 
This type of field can only be initialized using constructor injection.

Field injection introduces difficulties when writing tests as the dependencies 
have to be injected manually.
