Linked List in Java: All You Need to Know About it

Working Of Linked List in Java Is As Follows:
The Hierarchy of Linked Lists Is Explained as Follows:
There Are Various Types of Linked List. 

They Are:
Singular Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List


A linear data structure used to store the elements in contiguous locations is called a 
Linked List in Java. 

It has addresses and pointers that are used to link the elements, and each element in the 
linked list consists of two parts, namely the data part and the address part. 

The data part is the value of the element, and the address part consists of the pointers 
and addresses that are used to link the elements. 

Each element in the list is called a node.

The syntax to define a Linked list in Java is as follows:
    LinkedList <data_type> linkedlistname = new LinkedList<data_type>();
    where data_type is the data type of the elements to be stored in the linked list,
    linkedlistname is the name of the .linked list.

The usage of a linked list allows dynamic insertion and deletion of elements into the linked 
list. Because of this feature, linked lists are preferred over arrays.

Working Of Linked List in Java Is As Follows:
A linked list in Java is a dynamic data structure whose size increases as you add the elements 
and decreases as you remove the elements from the list.

The elements in the linked list are stored in containers.
The list holds the link to the first container.
All the containers have a link to the next container in the list.

Whenever you add an element to the list using add() operation, a new container is created, 
and this container is linked to the other containers in the list.
