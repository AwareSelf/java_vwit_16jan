What Is Stack?
Stack in data structure in computer science is similar to stack as a method of arranging 
items in the real world.

Stack is a linear data structure similar to arrays and linked lists, 
restricting the random access of elements. In arrays or linked lists, 
you can access the items via traversal or random indexing, but the stack data 
structure doesn't allow it either. A stack can be best understood by seeing it as a 
container of pieces that can only be stacked on top of each other and removed from that 
same direction only.

Stack as a data structure in computer science is similar to stack as a method 
of arranging items in the real world. A stack can be represented as a set of books 
piled on top of each other. These books can only be placed on each other from the top end. 
This scenario illustrates sequential book access, which is equivalent to the stack 
data structure in computer science.

Use of Stack:
The stacks are used for expression evaluation
The stacks are used for parentheses checking expressions
Stacks are used to convert expressions from one form to another
The stacks can be used as backtracking
Tower of Hanoi is the best use of stacks
Memory management and function are the application of stacks
The stacks are also used for string reversal
