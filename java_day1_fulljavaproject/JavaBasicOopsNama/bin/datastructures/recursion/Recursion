What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion. 
Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 
Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), 
Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, 
DFS of Graph, etc.

What are Recursion Functions? 
Recursive Functions are the corresponding functions that implement Recursion 
(Function calling itself) within them. A recursive function solves a particular 
problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the 
original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required.


Working of Recursion
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller sub-problems and 
add base conditions that stop the recursion. 
For example, we compute factorial n if we know the factorial of (n-1). 
The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0.
