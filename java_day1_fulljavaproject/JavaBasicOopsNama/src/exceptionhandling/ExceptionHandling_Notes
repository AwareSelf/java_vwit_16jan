java.lang.Throwable -> Error,Exception


anything i.e. Throwable can be handled
but you shouldnt handle java.lang.Error and its subtypes as they are
mostly fatal errors and so there's no use handling them . (bcz u cant deal with them in first place)

so u will handle java.lang.Exception and its subtypes

Exception -subtypes---> RuntimeException class, remaining classes like IOException,SQLException etc
which come under category of Non-Runtime Exceptions


Now, RuntimeException and its subclasses like ArithmaticException,NullPointerException
ClassCastException etc. are called as Unchecked Exceptions

whereas remaining non-RuntimeExceptions like SqlException,IOException etc which extend
from Excption but are not subclasses of RuntimeExcption --> Checked Exceptions.




Unchecked Exceptions - RuntimeException and its subclasses --> they occur due to 
programmer mistake in coding --> they could be detected during unit-testing when developer
tests his code. Once he detects this exception he will go and correct his code and then
this exception will never manifest post unit-testing,testing in entire lifetime of app run.
So compiler does not mandate /does not give compiler error if these ecxceptions are not
handled by the programmer.

for RuntimeException compiler will not check if programmer has written exception handling
code or not --> so they come under catgory of unchecked exceptions.

but same is not the case with non-Runtime exceptions. For example IOException or SQLException
can occur even if programmer has writter correct code. Because they depend on external resources
which could be down or corrupeted anytime.They can't be controller through programming by the
programmer. For example programmer cannot control if database goes down or if network goes down
and file from that network is not available for reading.

so in such cases compiler expects u to deal with such external situations by writing
exception handling code. so compiler checks if programmer has handled these kind of 
exceptions and gives error if not handled.
Bcz compiler checks these exceptions are handled --> so they come under category of checked
exceptions.
