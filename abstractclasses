  1) class -> method -> no body -> method as abstract
  2) class has (even one) abstract method --> entire class as abstract
  3) if class is abstract --> you can't create object of it
  4) if class is abstract --> cant create of object of it but
                           it can still available for inheritance

  5) when a class inherits from abstract class
     it has to override all abstract method of that class
     so as to bcm concrete class and create object of it

     even if single abstract method is not overriden then
     that class will still have abstarct methods in it so
     you will have to mark whole class as abstract and you
     cant create an object of it

     soln: create a one more subclass from this abstract class
      ans override the remaining abstract methods in it so that
      it will be bcm a concrete class and you can create object of
      it


      Shape -> abstract calcArea,abstract calcPm 
      Square -> calcArea override, calcPm (inherit abstarct)
             -> Square class abstract 
	     --> cant create object of Square class

      Hankerchief extends Square
            --> calcPm override
	    --> concrete
	    --> object --> can call calcArea, calcPm
